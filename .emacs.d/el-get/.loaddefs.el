FUNCTION is the color theme function which called `color-theme-install'.

automatic factoring of color themes.  This has been abandoned.

FRAME-PARAMETERS is an alist of frame parameters.  These are installed
with `color-theme-install-frame-params'.  These are installed last such
that any changes to the default face can be changed by the frame
parameters.

VARIABLE-DEFINITIONS is an alist of variable settings.  These are
installed with `color-theme-install-variables'.

with `color-theme-install-faces'.

done synchronously. There's `byte-compile' support though, and
the packages you use are welcome to use `autoload' too.

* `<type>:' : specifies a type of the package source
